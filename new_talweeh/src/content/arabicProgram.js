  'Our 2-Year Arabic course is meticulously designed, drawing from the rich Islamic tradition. In just 6 hours per week over the course of two years, students will confidently understand Quranic passages, navigate Arabic dictionaries, and read/translate unvowelized (without tashkīl) texts. The curriculum covers Nahw and Sarf sciences through multiple texts, with extensive reading practice. The program culminates in a detailed Tafsir of Juzz ‘Amma, introduction to Balaghah, and exploration of advanced Islamic sciences like Hadith, Fiqh, Aqeedah, and more.'

The foundational sciences of Ṣarf and Naḥw are introduced conceptually and practically, ensuring students understand not only definitions but function. Lessons are reinforced through consistent exercises and carefully selected examples from the Qur’an, cultivating analytical habits from the outset. Technical terminology becomes familiar, and students begin thinking structurally about language.

    a: 'The Talweeh 2-Year Arabic Program is a comprehensive and structured course designed to guide students from the foundations of Arabic toward the ability to confidently understand classical and Qurʾānic Arabic. Through a carefully sequenced curriculum, students progressively develop proficiency in Arabic grammar (Naḥw), Arabic morphology (Ṣarf), sentence analysis (Tarkīb), Arabic rhetoric (Balāghah), and reading and analyzing classical Arabic texts. By the end of the program, students gain the linguistic tools necessary to engage directly with Arabic texts and deepen their understanding of the language of the Qurʾān.',

    q: 'Who is this program designed for?',
    a: 'This program is suitable for beginners seeking a structured pathway to learning Arabic, students who can recite the Qurʾān but wish to understand its meaning, seekers of knowledge interested in Islamic scholarship, and individuals looking to build a strong linguistic foundation for studying Islamic sciences. No prior knowledge of Arabic grammar is required.',

    q: 'What will students learn during the program?',
    a: 'Students gradually develop proficiency in several essential Arabic disciplines: Arabic Grammar (Naḥw) — understanding how Arabic sentences are structured and how grammatical roles influence meaning; Arabic Morphology (Ṣarf) — studying verb patterns, root systems, and word derivation; Text Analysis (Tarkīb) — learning how to break down and analyze Arabic sentences and texts; Arabic Rhetoric (Balāghah) — exploring the eloquence and stylistic beauty of Arabic, particularly within the Qurʾān; and Applied Qurʾānic Language Analysis — analyzing Qurʾānic verses linguistically to appreciate deeper layers of meaning.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is the curriculum structured?',
    a: 'The program is divided into sequential modules that gradually build mastery. Module 1 – Foundations (3 months): the fundamental building blocks of the Arabic language, including types of words (noun, verb, particle), basic sentence structures, an introduction to Naḥw and Ṣarf, foundational vocabulary and phrase construction, and introductory Balāghah. Module 2 – Applied Grammar & Reading (6 months): students begin engaging with real Arabic texts while strengthening grammar and morphology — studying foundational Arabic grammar texts, learning verb patterns and morphological systems, reading classical narratives, and developing sentence analysis and reading comprehension skills. Advanced Modules introduce advanced syntax and grammatical theory, sentence parsing (Iʿrāb), classical Arabic literature, linguistic analysis of Qurʾānic passages, and the science of Balāghah.',

    q: 'Will the program help me understand the Qurʾān?',

The last module will be a direct application upon the 30th Juz of the Qur’an using linguistic-based Tafaseer. Students will learn to recognize grammatical structures in Qurʾānic verses, understand how morphology and syntax affect meaning, identify rhetorical features used within the Qurʾān, and analyze verses through linguistic principles.

    title: 'About Talweeh Arabic',
    paragraphs: [
      'Talweeh Arabic is a structured, multi-level Arabic language program designed to take students from beginner foundations to advanced proficiency in reading and analyzing classical texts. Built upon years of instructional experience and careful curriculum refinement, the program selects time-tested works in naḥw (syntax), ṣarf (morphology), balāghah (rhetoric), and applied literature to ensure steady and measurable growth. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive academic journey rather than isolated language study.',
      'Our approach combines traditional text-based learning with active application. Students do not simply memorize rules; they learn to perform iʿrāb (grammatical parsing), analyze sentence structures (tarkīb), translate accurately, and appreciate the rhetorical depth of Arabic expression. The result is not passive familiarity, but confident engagement with the language.',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Applied Learning',
    paragraphs: [
      'Alongside technical mastery, Talweeh Arabic emphasizes practical language skills. Weekly ḥiwār (conversation) sessions develop spoken fluency, while structured writing exercises reinforce grammatical accuracy and vocabulary retention. Live sessions provide opportunities for clarification, discussion, and applied analysis, ensuring that learning remains interactive and accountable. Students graduate from the program not only able to read Arabic texts, but able to think through them—analyzing structures, evaluating interpretations, and articulating meaning with precision.',

  },
  {
    title: 'Curriculum Structure',
    paragraphs: [
      'The Talweeh curriculum is carefully sequenced across progressive modules that integrate grammar, morphology, literature, poetry, and linguistic tafsīr. Students begin with the essential building blocks of Arabic—word categories, sentence formation, and verb patterns—before advancing to detailed syntactic theory and complex morphological systems.',
      'As they progress, learners study classical prose and poetry, strengthening their ability to detect subtle grammatical shifts, rhetorical emphasis, and layered meanings. Advanced modules introduce applied iʿrāb methodology, rare grammatical cases, and nuanced sentence analysis, preparing students to approach large classical works with independence and clarity.',
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Scholarly Focus',
    paragraphs: [
      'Talweeh Arabic treats language as the key to understanding revelation and scholarship. Through guided linguistic tafsīr and structured analysis of Qur’anic passages, students learn how grammar and morphology shape meaning. They become accustomed to consulting recognized classical exegetes and identifying how variations in structure affect interpretation.',
      'By integrating syntax, morphology, and rhetoric, students develop a holistic understanding of Qur’anic discourse. This foundation prepares them to transition smoothly into the broader Islamic sciences, including tafsīr, ḥadīth, fiqh, uṣūl, and balāghah, all offered by Talweeh Academy.',

  {
    title: 'Mission Statement',
    paragraphs: [
      'Talweeh Arabic exists to bridge classical tradition and structured modern pedagogy. Our mission is to produce students who approach the Arabic language with confidence, depth, and intellectual discipline. By the completion of the program, learners are equipped with the analytical tools necessary to engage advanced Islamic studies and classical literature independently.',
